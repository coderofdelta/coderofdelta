### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kingsley an Android developer and lifelong learner that loves building apps that help users be more productive and solve problems. I currently spend most of my time working on projects with small teams. I am looking to get hired in teams or companies where I will be exposed to new challenges that I can help solve with my skills.
